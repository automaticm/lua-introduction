# Chess Game in Lua
### Finished
	Initializing the chess board
	Placing chess pieces
	Printing the board
	Setting the metatable of board (indexable via string)
### To-Do
	Command-user input from user to user
	Capturing pieces (goes hand and hhand with user input)
	Point system from capturing pieces (points defined in init.lua)
	Check valid moves (check, checkmate, draw)
	 > Check
	 	> King is in an attack and needs to move out the way
	 > Checkmate
	  	 > No valid moves for the king and no pieces can capture the checkmated king.
	 > Draw
		 > Should automatically be a draw if no pieces, only one
		 > knight, only one bishop
	

# lua-introduction

### basics (expand later)
	no zero-based indexing (1-based-indexing)
	tables are the only formal data structuring mechanism
